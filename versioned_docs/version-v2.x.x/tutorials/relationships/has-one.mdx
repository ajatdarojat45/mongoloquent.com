## One to One Relationship

A one-to-one relationship is a very basic type of database relationship. For example, a `User` model might be associated with one `Phone` model. To define this relationship, we will place a `phone` method on the `User` model. The `phone` method should call the `hasOne` method and return its result.

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Phone from "./yourPath/Phone";

class User extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "users";

	static phone() {
		return this.hasOne(Phone, "userId", "_id");
	}
}
```

The first argument passed to the `hasOne` method is the name of the related model class. Once the relationship is defined, we may retrieve the related record using Mongoloquent's dynamic properties. Dynamic properties allow you to access relationship methods as if they were properties defined on the model:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const user = await User.with("phone").find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

// you can access your data in the data property
console.log(user.data);
```

Additionally, Mongoloquent assumes that the foreign key should have a value matching the primary key column of the parent. In other words, Mongoloquent will look for the value of the user's `_id` column in the `userId` column of the Phone record.

### Defining the Inverse of the Relationship

So, we can access the Phone model from our User model. Next, let's define a relationship on the Phone model that will let us access the user that owns the phone. We can define the inverse of a `hasOne` relationship using the `belongsTo` method:

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import User from "./yourPath/User";

class Phone extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "phones";

	static user() {
		return this.belongsTo(User, "userId", "_id");
	}
}

// usage
const phone = await Phone.with("user").find("10ab7e3d05d58a1ad250dd90");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(phone.data);
```

When invoking the user method, Mongoloquent will attempt to find a User model that has an `_id` which matches the `userId` column on the Phone model.
