### Inserts

Of course, when using Mongoloquent, we don't only need to retrieve models from the database. We also need to insert new records. Thankfully, Mongoloquent makes it simple. To insert a new record into the database, you can call the `insert` or `create` method on the model:

```js
import Flight from "./yourPath/Flight";

const flight = await Flight.create({
	name: "London to Paris",
});
```

### Updates

Updates can be performed against models that match a given query. In this example, all flights that are `active` and have a `destination` of `San Diego` will be marked as delayed:

```js
await Flight.where("active", true).where("destination", "San Diego").update({
	delayed: true,
});
```

The update method expects an array of column and value pairs representing the columns that should be updated.
