## Running Database Queries

### Retrieving All Rows From a Collection

You may use the `class` extended `Mongoloquent` to begin a query. The `class` method returns a fluent query builder instance for the given collection, allowing you to chain more constraints onto the query and then finally retrieve the results of the query using the `get` method:

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";

class User extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "users";
	static softDelete = true;
	static timestamps = true;
}

const users = await User.get();
```

Also, you can using the `all` method

```js
const users = await User.all();
```

### Retrieving a Single Document From a Collection

If you just need to retrieve a single row from a database collection, you may use the Mongoloquent's `first` method. This method will return a single object:

```js
const user = await User.where("name", "Udin").first();

// you can access the query result in the data property
console.log(user.data);
```

To retrieve a single row by its `_id` key value, use the `find` method:

```js
const user = await User.find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

// you can access the query result in the data property
console.log(user.data);
```

### Retrieving a List of Column Values

If you would like to retrieve an array containing the values of a single key, you may use the `pluck` method. In this example, we'll retrieve a `array` of user titles:

```js
const titles = await User.pluck("title");
```

## Aggregates

The `Mongoloquent` also provides a variety of methods for retrieving aggregate values like `count`, `max`, `min`, `avg`, and `sum`. You may call any of these methods after constructing your query:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";
import Order from "./yourPath/Order";

const users = await User.count();

const price = await Order.max("price");
```

Of course, you may combine these methods with other clauses to fine-tune how your aggregate value is calculated:

```js
const price = await Order.where("finalized", 1).avg("price");
```

## Select Statements

### Specifying a Select Clause

You may not always want to select all columns from a database collection. Using the `select` method, you can specify a custom "select" clause for the query:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const users = await User.select("name").select("email").get();
```

Also, you can passing a array of keys into `select` method

```js
const users = await User.select(["name", "emai"]).get();
```

### Specifying a Exclude Clause

You may want to exclude specific keys from a database collection. Using the `exclude` method, you can specify a custom "exclude" clause for the query:

```js
const users = await User.exclude("name").exclude("email").get();
```

Also, you can passing a array of keys into `exclude` method

```js
const users = await User.exclude(["name", "emai"]).get();
```

## Basic Where Clauses

### Where Clauses

You may use the query `where` method to add "where" clauses to the query. The most basic call to the `where` method requires three arguments. The first argument is the name of the `key`. The second argument is an `operator,` which can be any of the database's [supported operators](/docs/api-references/operator). The third argument is the `value` to compare against the column's value.

For example, the following query retrieves users where the value of the `votes` key is equal to `100` and the value of the `age` key is greater than `35`:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const users = await User.where("votes", "=", 100).where("age", ">=", 35).get();
```

For convenience, if you want to verify that a column is `=` to a given value, you may pass the value as the second argument to the `where` method. `Mongoloquent` will assume you would like to use the `=` operator:

```js
const users = await User.where("votes", 100).get();
```

As previously mentioned, you may use any operator that is supported by your database system:

```js
users = await User.where("votes", ">=", 100).get();

users = await User.where("votes", "<=", 100).get();

users = await User.where("name", "like", "T").get();
```

### Or Where Clauses

When chaining together calls to the query `where` method, the "where" clauses will be joined together using the `and` operator. However, you may use the `orWhere` method to join a clause to the query using the `or` operator. The `orWhere` method accepts the same arguments as the `where` method:

```js
users = await User.where("votes", ">", 100).orWhere("name", "Jhon").get();
```

### Additional Where Clauses

#### whereBetween / orWhereBetween

The `whereBetween` method verifies that a key's value is between two values:

```js
const users = await User.whereBetween("votes", [1, 100]).get();
```

#### whereIn / whereNotIn / orWhereIn / orWhereNotIn

The `whereIn` method verifies that a given key's value is contained within the given array:

```js
const users = await User.whereIn("_id", [
	"01ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87",
	"02ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87",
	"03ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87",
]).get();
```

The `whereNotIn` method verifies that the given key's value is not contained in the given array:

```js
const users = await User.whereNotIn("_id", [
	"01ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87",
	"02ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87",
	"03ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87",
]).get();
```

## Ordering, Grouping, Limit and Offset

### Ordering

#### The orderBy Method

The `orderBy` method allows you to sort the results of the query by a given key. The first argument accepted by the `orderBy` method should be the key you wish to sort by, while the second argument determines the direction of the sort and may be either `asc` or `desc`:

```js
const users = await User.orderBy("name", "desc").get();
```

To sort by multiple keys, you may simply invoke `orderBy` as many times as necessary:

```js
const users = await User.orderBy("name", "desc").orderBy("email", "asc").get();
```

### Grouping

#### The groupBy Method

As you might expect, the `groupBy` method may be used to group the query results.

```js
users = await User.groupBy("accountId").get();
```

### Limit and Offset

#### The skip and take Methods

You may use the `skip` and `take` methods to limit the number of results returned from the query or to skip a given number of results in the query:

```js
const users = await User.skip(10).take(5).get();
```

Alternatively, you may use the `limit` and `offset` methods. These methods are functionally equivalent to the `take` and `skip` methods, respectively:

```js
const users = await User.offset(10).limit(5).get();
```

## Insert Statements

The query also provides an `insert` method that may be used to insert records into the database collection. The `insert` method accepts an object of key names and values:

```js
await User.insert({
	email: "udin@mail.com",
	votes: 0,
});
```

You may insert several records at once by passing an array of object. Each array represents a record that should be inserted into the collection:

```js
await User.insertMany([
	{
		email: "udin@mail.com",
		votes: 0,
	},
	{
		email: "kosasih@mail.com",
		votes: 0,
	},
]);
```

## Update Statements

In addition to inserting records into the database, the query can also update existing records using the `update` method. The `update` method, like the `insert` method, accepts an object of key and value pairs indicating the keys to be updated. You may constrain the update query using where clauses:

```js
await User.where("_id", "03ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87").update({
	votes: 1,
});
```

You may update several records by invoked `updateMany`

```js
await User.where("votes", 0).updateMany({
	votes: 1,
});
```

## Delete Statements

The query `delete` method may be used to delete records from the collection. You may constrain `delete` statements by adding "where" clauses before calling the delete method:

```js
await User.delete();

await User.where("votes", ">", 100).delete();
```

Also, you can delete multiple documents that match queries by invoking the `deleteMany` method.

```js
await User.where("votes", ">", 100).deleteMany();
```

### Deleting an Existing Data by its Primary Key

if you know the primary key of the model, you may delete the model without explicitly retrieving it by calling the `destroy` method. In addition to accepting the single primary key, the `destroy` method will accept multiple primary keys or an array of primary keys:

```js
import Flight from "./yourPath/Flight";

await Flight.destroy("10ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

await Flight.destroy(["20ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87", "30ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87"]);
```

### Deleting Data Using Queries

Of course, you may build an Mongoloquent query to delete all models matching your query's criteria. In this example, we will delete all `flights` that are marked as `inactive`.

```js
const deleted = await Flight.where("active", false).deleteMany();
```
