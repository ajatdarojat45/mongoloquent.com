## One to Many (Polymorphic)

### Collection Structure

A one-to-many polymorphic relation is similar to a typical one-to-many relation; however, the child model can belong to more than one type of model using a single association. For example, imagine users of your application can "comment" on posts and videos. Using polymorphic relationships, you may use a single comments table to contain `comments` for both posts and videos. First, let's examine the table structure required to build this relationship:

```
posts
    _id - ObjectId
    title - string
    body - text

videos
    _id - ObjectId
    title - string
    url - string

comments
    _id - ObjectId
    body - text
    commentableId - ObjectId
    commentableType - string

```

### Model Structure

Next, let's examine the model definitions needed to build this relationship:

```javascript
// Comment.js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";

class Comment extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "comments";
	static softDelete = true;
	static timestamps = true;
}
```

```javascript
// Post.js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Comment from "./yourPath/Comment";

class Post extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "posts";
	static softDelete = true;
	static timestamps = true;

	/**
	 * Get all of the post's comments.
	 */
	static comments() {
		return this.morphMany(Comment, "commentable");
	}
}
```

```javascript
// Video.js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Comment from "./yourPath/Comment";

class Video extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "videos";
	static softDelete = true;
	static timestamps = true;

	/**
	 * Get all of the post's comments.
	 */
	static comments() {
		return this.morphMany(Comment, "commentable");
	}
}
```

### Retrieving the Relationship

Once your database table and models are defined, you may access the relationships via your model's dynamic relationship properties. For example, to access all of the comments for a post, we can use the comments dynamic property:

```javascript
import Post from "./yourPath/Post";

const post = await Post.with("comments").find("10ab7e3d05d58a1ad250dd90");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(post.data);
```

```javascript
import Video from "./yourPath/Video";

const video = await Video.with("comments").find("11bb7e3d05d58a1ad250dd99");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(video.data);
```
