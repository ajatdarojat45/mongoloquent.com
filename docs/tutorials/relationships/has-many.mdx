## One to Many Relationship

A one-to-many relationship is used to define relationships where a single model is the parent to one or more child models. For example, a blog `post` may have an infinite number of `comments`. Like all other `Mongoloquent` relationships, one-to-many relationships are defined by defining a method on your `Mongoloquent` model.

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Comment from "./yourPath/Comment";

class Post extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "posts";

	static comments() {
		return this.hasMany(Comment, "postId", "_id");
	}
}
```

Once the relationship method has been defined, we can access the `collection` of related comments by accessing the comments property in the data property.

```js
import Post from "./yourPath/Post";

const post = await Post.with("comments").find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(post.data);
```
