## hasManyThrough(Model, throughModel, foreignKey, throughForeignKey)

The "has-many-through" relationship provides a convenient way to access distant relations via an intermediate relation. For example, let's assume we are building a deployment platform. A `Project` model might access many `Deployment` models through an intermediate `Environment` model. Using this example, you could easily gather all deployments for a given project. Let's look at the collections required to define this relationship:

### Collection structure

```
projects
    _id - id
    name - string

environments
    _id - id
    projectId - id
    name - string

deployments
    _id - id
    environmentId - id
    commitHash - string
```

Now that we have examined the collection structure for the relationship, let's define the relationship on the `Project` model:

### Usage

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Environment from "./yourPath/Environment";
import Deployment from "./yourPath/Deployment";

class Project extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "projects";

	static deployments() {
		return this.hasManyThrough(
			Deployment,
			Environment,
			"projectId",
			"environmentId"
		);
	}
}

// usage
const project = await Project.where("_id", "65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87")
	.with("deployments")
	.first();
```

Also, you can pass collection name as a Model.

> The softDelete is disabled in the target model when you pass the collection name as a model.

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Environment from "./yourPath/Environment";
import Deployment from "./yourPath/Deployment";

class Project extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "projects";

	static deployments() {
		return this.hasManyThrough(
			"deployments",
			"environments",
			"projectId",
			"environmentId"
		);
	}
}

// usage
const project = await Project.where("_id", "65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87")
	.with("deployments")
	.first();
```
