## One to Many (Inverse) / Belongs To

### Belongs To

Now that we can access all of a post's comments, let's define a relationship to allow a comment to access its parent post. To define the inverse of a `hasMany` relationship, define a relationship method on the child model which calls the `belongsTo` method:

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Post from "./yourPath/Post";

class Comment extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "comments";

	static post() {
		return this.belongsTo(Post, "postId", "_id");
	}
}
```

Once the relationship has been defined, we can retrieve a comment's parent post by accessing the `post` "dynamic relationship property":

```js
import Comment from "./yourPath/Comment";

const comment = await Comment.with("post").find("50ab7e3d05d58a1ad246aa87");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(comment.data);
```

### Select and Exclude Related Model Keys

Monggoloquent can also `select` or `exclude` certain related model `keys`

```js
import Comment from "./yourPath/Comment";

// with select keys
await Comment.with("post", {
	select: ["title"],
}).find("50ab7e3d05d58a1ad246aa87");

// with exclude keys
await Comment.with("comments", {
	exclude: ["title"],
}).find("50ab7e3d05d58a1ad246aa87");
```
