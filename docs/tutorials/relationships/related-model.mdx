## Many to Many Relationships

### Attaching / Detaching

Mongoloquent also provides methods to make working with many-to-many relationships more convenient. For example, let's imagine a user can have many roles and a role can have many users. You may use the `attach` method to attach a role to a user by inserting a record in the relationship's intermediate table:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User"

const user = await User.find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

const roleId = "60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60"
await user->roles()->attach(roleId);
```

Sometimes it may be necessary to remove a role from a user. To remove a many-to-many relationship record, use the `detach` method. The `detach` method will delete the appropriate record out of the intermediate table; however, both models will remain in the database:

```js
// Detach a single role from the user...
await user.roles().detach(roleId);

// Detach all roles from the user...
await user.roles().detach();
```

For convenience, `attach` and `detach` also accept arrays of IDs as input:

```js
const user = await User.find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

await user
	.roles()
	.detach(["60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60", "70ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee70"]);

await user
	.roles()
	.attach(["60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60", "70ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee70"]);
```

### Syncing Associations

You may also use the `sync` method to construct many-to-many associations. The `sync` method accepts an array of IDs to place on the intermediate table. Any IDs that are not in the given array will be removed from the intermediate collection. So, after this operation is complete, only the IDs in the given array will exist in the intermediate collection:

```js
await user.roles().sync("60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60");
```

For convenience, `sync` also accept arrays of IDs as input:

```js
await user
	.roles()
	.sync(["60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60", "70ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee70"]);
```
