## Soft Deleting

In addition to actually removing records from your database, `Mongoloquent` can also `soft delete` models. When models are soft deleted, they are not actually removed from your database. Instead, a `isDeleted` and `deletedAt` attribute is set on the model indicating the date and time at which the model was "deleted". To enable soft deletes for a model, add the static property `softDelete` to the model.

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";

class User extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "users";
	static softDelete = true;
}
```

> The static property softDelete will automatically add the isDeleted and deletedAt attributes to your model.

### Restoring Soft Deleted Models

Sometimes you may wish to "un-delete" a soft deleted model. To restore a soft deleted model, you may call the `restore` method on a model. The `restore` method will set the model's `deletedAt` column to `null` and `isDeleted` column to `false`.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

await User.withTrashed().restore();
```

You may also combine the `restore` method with query methods to restore multiple models/data.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

await User.withTrashed().where("age", ">=", 50).restore();
```

### Permanently Deleting Models

Sometimes you may need to truly remove a model from your database. You may use the `forceDelete` method to permanently remove a soft deleted model from the database collection.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

await User.forceDelete();
```

You may also combine the `forceDelete` method with query methods to permanently delete some specific soft deleted models/data.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

await User.where("age", 50).forceDelete();
```

## Querying Soft Deleted Models

### Including Soft Deleted Models

As noted above, soft deleted models will automatically be excluded from query results. However, you may force soft deleted models to be included in a query's results by calling the withTrashed method on the query.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const users = await User.withTrashed().where("age", ">=" 50).get()
```

### Retrieving Only Soft Deleted Models

The `onlyTrashed` method will retrieve only soft deleted models.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const users = await User.onlyTrashed().where("age", "gte" 50).get()
```
