## Create

### insert

Of course, when using Mongoloquent, we don't only need to retrieve models from the database. We also need to insert new records. Thankfully, Mongoloquent makes it simple.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const data = {
	name: "Udin",
	age: 17,
	email: "udin@mail.com",
};

const user = await User.insert(data);
```

### create

The `create` method is an alias for the [`insert`](#insertdata) method.

### insertMany

The `insertMany` method used to insert multiple documents into the database collection.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const data = [
	{
		name: "Udin",
		age: 17,
		email: "udin@mail.com",
	},
	{
		name: "Kosasih",
		age: 20,
		email: "kosasih@mail.com",
	},
];

const user = await User.insertMany(data);
```

## Update

### update

Update a single document that matches a given query.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const data = { name: "Udin Edited" };

const user = await User.where("_id", "65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87").update(data);
```

### updateMany

Update multiple documents that matches a given query.

```js
import Flight from "./yourPath/Flight";

await Flight.where("isActive", true)
	.where("destination", "Bogor")
	.updateMany({ delayed: true });
```

The `updateMany` method returns the number of affected documents.

## Delete

### delete

Delete a single document that matches a given query.

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const user = await User.where("_id", "65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87").delete();
```

### deleteMany

Delete multiple documents that matches a given query.

```js
import Flight from "./yourPath/Flight";

await Flight.where("isActive", false).deleteMany();
```

The `deleteMany` method returns the number of affected documents.

### destroy

Delete multiple documents that matches a given ids.

```js
import Flight from "./yourPath/Flight";

await Flight.destroy("660034987147a7d233501c8a");
```

Also you can passing multiple records.

```js
import Flight from "./yourPath/Flight";

await Flight.destroy(["660034987147a7d233501c8a", "660034d7dbcd54dd425e2723"]);
```

The `destroy` method returns the number of affected documents.
