## One to One (Polymorphic)

### Table Structure

Table Structure
A one-to-one polymorphic relation is similar to a typical one-to-one relation; however, the child model can belong to more than one type of model using a single association. For example, a blog `Post` and a `User` may share a polymorphic relation to an `Image` model. Using a one-to-one polymorphic relation allows you to have a single table of unique images that may be associated with posts and users. First, let's examine the table structure:

```
posts
  _id - ObjectId
  name - string

users
  _id - ObjectId
  name - string

images
  _id - ObjectId
  url - string
  imageableId - ObjectId
  imageableType - string
```

Note the `imageableId` and `imageableType` columns on the images collection. The `imageableId` column will contain the ID value of the post or user, while the `imageableType` column will contain the class name of the parent model. The `imageableType` column is used by Mongoloquent to determine which "type" of parent model to return when accessing the imageable relation. In this case, the column would contain either `Post` or `User`.

### Model Structure

Next, let's examine the model definitions needed to build this relationship:

```javascript
// Image.js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";

class Image extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "images";
	static softDelete = true;
	static timestamps = true;
}
```

```javascript
// Post.js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Image from "./yourPath/Image";

class Post extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "posts";
	static softDelete = true;
	static timestamps = true;

	static image() {
		return this.morphOne(Image, "imageable");
	}
}
```

```javascript
// User.js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Image from "./yourPath/Image";

class User extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "users";
	static softDelete = true;
	static timestamps = true;

	static image() {
		return this.morphOne(Image, "imageable");
	}
}
```

### Retrieving the Relationship

Once your database collection and models are defined, you may access the relationships via your models. For example, to retrieve the image for a post, we can access the image dynamic relationship property:

```javascript
import Post from "./yourPath/Post";

const post = await Post.with("image").find("09ab7e3d05d58a1ad250dd80");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(post.data);
```

```javascript
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const video = await User.with("image").find("77bb7e3d05d58a1ad250dd80");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(video.data);
```
