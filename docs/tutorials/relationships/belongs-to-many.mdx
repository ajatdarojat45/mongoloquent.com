## Many to Many Relationship

Many-to-many relations are slightly more complicated than hasOne and hasMany relationships. An example of a many-to-many relationship is a user that has many roles and those roles are also shared by other users in the application. For example, a user may be assigned the role of "Author" and "Editor"; however, those roles may also be assigned to other users as well. So, a user has many roles and a role has many users.

### Collection structure

To define this relationship, three database collections are needed: `users`, `roles`, and `roleUser`. The `roleUser` collection is derived from the alphabetical order of the related model names and contains `userId` and `roleId` columns. This collection is used as an intermediate collection linking the `users` and `roles`.

Remember, since a role can belong to many users, we cannot simply place a `userId` column on the `roles` collection. This would mean that a role could only belong to a single user. In order to provide support for roles being assigned to multiple users, the `roleUser` table is needed. We can summarize the relationship's table structure like so:

```
users
  _id - ObjectId
  name - string

roles
  _id - ObjectId
  name - string

roleUser
  _id - ObjectId
  userId - ObjectId
  roleId - ObjectId
```

### Model Structure

Many-to-many relationships are defined by writing a method that returns the result of the belongsToMany method. For example, let's define a `roles` method on our `User` model. The first argument passed to this method is the name of the related model class:

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import Role from "./yourPath/Role";
import RoleUser from "./yourPath/RoleUser";

class User extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "users";

	static roles() {
		return this.belongsToMany(Role, RoleUser, "userId", "roleId");
	}
}
```

Once the relationship is defined, you may access the user's roles using the `roles` dynamic relationship property:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const user = await User.with("roles").find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

// your relationship data can accessed in the data property
console.log(user.data);
```

### Defining the Inverse of the Relationship

To define the "inverse" of a many-to-many relationship, you should define a method on the related model which also returns the result of the belongsToMany method. To complete our user / role example, let's define the users method on the Role model:

```js
import { Mongoloquent } from "mongoloquent";
import User from "./yourPath/User";
import RoleUser from "./yourPath/RoleUser";

class Role extends Mongoloquent {
	static collection = "roles";

	static users() {
		return this.belongsToMany(User, RoleUser, "roleId", "userId");
	}
}
```
