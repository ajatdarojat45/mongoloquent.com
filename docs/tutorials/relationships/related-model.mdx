title: Inserting and Updating Related Models

## The `insert` Method

Mongoloquent provides convenient methods for adding new models to relationships. For example, perhaps you need to add a new comment to a post. Instead of manually setting the `postId` attribute on the `Comment` model you may insert the comment using the relationship's `insert` method:

```js
import Post from "./yourPath/Post";

const post = await Post.find("77ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

await post.comments().save({ message: "A new comment." });
// or
await post.comments().insert({ message: "A new comment." });
```

Note that we did not access the `comments` relationship as a dynamic property. Instead, we called the `comments` method to obtain an instance of the relationship. The save method will automatically add the appropriate `postId` value to the new `Comment` model.

If you need to save multiple related models, you may use the `insertMany` method:

```js
const post = await Post.find("77ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

await post
	.comments()
	.insertMany([
		{ message: "A new comment." },
		{ message: "Another new comment." },
	]);
```

You may also use the `save` and `create` methods to create models on relationships.

## Many to Many Relationships

### Attaching / Detaching

Mongoloquent also provides methods to make working with many-to-many relationships more convenient. For example, let's imagine a user can have many roles and a role can have many users. You may use the `attach` method to attach a role to a user by inserting a record in the relationship's intermediate collection:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User"

const user = await User.find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

await user->roles()->attach("60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60");
```

Sometimes it may be necessary to remove a role from a user. To remove a many-to-many relationship record, use the `detach` method. The `detach` method will delete the appropriate record out of the intermediate collection; however, both models will remain in the database:

```js
// Detach a single role from the user...
await user.roles().detach(roleId);

// Detach multiple roles from the user...
await user
	.roles()
	.detach(["60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60", "70ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee70"]);
```

For convenience, `attach` and `detach` also accept arrays of IDs as input:

```js
const user = await User.find("65ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee87");

await user
	.roles()
	.detach(["60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60", "70ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee70"]);

await user
	.roles()
	.attach(["60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60", "70ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee70"]);
```

### Syncing Associations

You may also use the `sync` method to construct many-to-many associations. The `sync` method accepts an array of IDs to place on the intermediate collection. Any IDs that are not in the given array will be removed from the intermediate collection. So, after this operation is complete, only the IDs in the given array will exist in the intermediate collection:

```js
await user.roles().sync("60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60");
```

For convenience, `sync` also accept arrays of IDs as input:

```js
await user
	.roles()
	.sync(["60ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee60", "70ab7e3d05d58a1ad246ee70"]);
```
