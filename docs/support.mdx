# Support

Mongoloquent is an MIT-licensed open source project with its ongoing development made possible thanks to the support by the community. This library is a result of the long road, full of sleepless nights, working after hours, and busy weekends.

## How can you help?

Mongoloquent doesn't have a large company that sits behind and is continuously paying for hours spent on the development. I fully rely on the **goodness** ❤️ of the people. However, I would love to make this library even more **powerful**, to be fully focused on delivering you great solutions that make coding process enjoyable: In order to help me, I run few supporting platforms:

- become a backer or sponsor on [Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/ajatdarojat45)
- or reach me directly: ajatdarojat45@gmail.com

If you fell in love with Mongoloquent, or you run a business which is using Mongoloquent, consider sponsoring its development to ensure that the project which your product relies on is **actively maintained** and improved.
