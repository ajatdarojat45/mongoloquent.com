## Basic Usage

### Paginating Query Builder Results

There are several ways to paginate items. The simplest is by using the `paginate` method. The `paginate` method automatically takes care of setting the query's "limit" and "offset" based on the current page being viewed by the user.

In this example, the only argument passed to the `paginate` method is the number of items you would like displayed "per page". In this case, let's specify that we would like to display `15` items per page:

```js
import User from "./yourPath/User";

const user = await User.paginate(1, 15);
```

Of course, you may call the `paginate` method after setting other constraints on the query, such as `where` clauses:

```js
const user = await User.where("votes", ">", 100).paginate(1, 15);
```

### Paginate Results

THe `paginate` method will include meta information such as `total`, `currentPage`, `lastPage`, and more. The result records are available via the data key in the JSON array. Here is an example of the data returned by returning a paginate method:

```js
 {
    "data": [
        {
            // Record...
        },
        {
            // Record...
        }
    ],
    "meta": {
        "total": 50,
        "page": 1,
        "perPage": 15,
        "lastPage": 4,
    },
};

```
